    "- send() accepts a json object and returns the hexademical hash value generated using hmac-sha256 and a shared key\n",
    "- verify() receives a json object and hash value then checks if the json object has changed and if it has been signed with the same key. **HINT:** Make use of the hmac.compare_digest method.\n",

    "      **get_checksum:** uses zlib to generate a checksum<br/>\n",

    "      **hmac_equals:** compares two hmac digests in a secure way<br/>\n",
    "      **get_symmetric_token:** generates a token using symmetric key encryption<br/>\n",
    "      **deciper:** uses symmetric key decrpytion to change a token to plaintext<br/>\n",
